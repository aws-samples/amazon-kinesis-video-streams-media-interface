# Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Media Interface

## Introduction

**Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Media Interface** provides abstract interfaces for board specific media APIs. This repository also contains SoCs sensors/encoder implementations for Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Producer and WebRTC with out-of-box samples.

## Supported SoCs

- T31

## Getting started with out-of-box KVS WebRTC sample

1. Generate AWS credentials by using this [script](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc-sdk-c/blob/master/scripts/generate-iot-credential.sh)
2. Copy SoC SDK dependencies into *3rdparty/$BOARD/*. See [3rdparty/README.md](3rdparty/README.md).
3. Clone and build the code:
```
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-media-interface.git
cd amazon-kinesis-video-streams-media-interface
mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..
make
```
4. Upload built artifacts(i.e kvswebrtcmaster-static) at *amazon-kinesis-video-streams-media-interface/build/samples/webrtc/* to your board.
5. Setup AWS credentials in enjoinment variables. The sample is using AWS IoT certificates by default:
```bash
export AWS_KVS_LOG_LEVEL=2
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
export AWS_KVS_CACERT_PATH=cacert.pem
export AWS_IOT_CORE_THING_NAME=your_camera_name
export AWS_IOT_CORE_CREDENTIAL_ENDPOINT=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.credentials.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
export AWS_IOT_CORE_CERT=your_camera_certificate.pem
export AWS_IOT_CORE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_camera_private.key
export AWS_IOT_CORE_ROLE_ALIAS=your_camera_role_alias
```
6. Execute sample on your board: `./kvswebrtcmaster-static`
7. Check WebRTC live stream via AWS console or [AWS WebRTC test page]()

## Getting started with out-of-box KVS Producer sample

1. Copy SoC SDK dependencies into *3rdparty/$BOARD/*. See [3rdparty/README.md](3rdparty/README.md).
2. Clone and build the code:
```
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-media-interface.git
cd amazon-kinesis-video-streams-media-interface
mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DBUILD_KVS_SAMPLES=ON
make
```
3. Upload built artifacts(i.e kvsproducer-static) at *amazon-kinesis-video-streams-media-interface/build/samples/kvs/* to your board.
4. Setup AWS credentials in enjoinment variables. The sample is using AWS access key/secret key by default:
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
export AWS_KVS_HOST=kinesisvideo.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```
5. Execute sample on your board: `./kvsproducer-static $YOUR_STREAM_NAME`
6. Check DASH live stream via [AWS KVS test page](https://aws-samples.github.io/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-media-viewer/)
7. Download video clips via AWS console.

> In current stage, browser doesn't support G.711 via HLS/DASH. To verify audio content in G.711 formats, user must download video clips.

## Platform Implementation Guide

To adapt other platforms SDKs with **Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Media Interface**, you need to implement interfaces in *include/com/amazonaws/kinesis/video/capturer/VideoCapturer.h*, *include/com/amazonaws/kinesis/video/capturer/AudioCapturer.h* and *include/com/amazonaws/kinesis/video/player/AudioPlayer.h*:

- [VideoCapturer.h](include/com/amazonaws/kinesis/video/capturer/VideoCapturer.h): abstract interfaces defined for video capturer sensor/encoder.
- [AudioCapturer.h](include/com/amazonaws/kinesis/video/capturer/AudioCapturer.h): abstract interfaces defined for audio capturer sensor/encoder.
- [AudioPlayer.h](include/com/amazonaws/kinesis/video/player/AudioPlayer.h): abstract interfaces defined for audio playback sensor/encoder.
